# ðŸŽ¯ Questionnaire Matching System

Ever wanted to group people together but too lazy to do it manually? Same. That's why I built this totally-not-over-engineered system that does it for you! It takes responses from a questionnaire and magically (using math, not actual magic, sorry) groups people based on their compatibility.

## ðŸš€ Setup (I Promise It's Easy)

1. Clone this bad boy:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Questionnaire.git
cd Questionnaire
```

2. Install the goods (aka dependencies):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the thing:
```bash
python matching.py
```

That's it! No API keys, no environment variables, no sacrificial offerings needed. Just pure, simple, grouping magic. âœ¨

If something breaks, try turning it off and on again. If that doesn't work, feel free to open an issue and I'll pretend to know what's wrong.
